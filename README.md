# Classifying Mushroom Edibility with Machine Learning

This project tries to utilize a vast number of physical characteristics of mushrooms to determine if the mushroom is edible or poisonous.

Several machine learning models were used to classify mushrooms into those two categories, edible or poisonous. The models that were used in this study include: Naïve Bayes, C5.0, Bagged CART, Random Forest, Ada Boost, Gradient Boost, and a convolutional Neural Network. These models were trained on 8124 observations of 23 variables that represented different physical attributes of the mushrooms. The study found that of the models used all but Naïve Bayes was able to perfectly classify the mushrooms observations in the test set.

The R programming language was used as well as RStudio to create the models.
